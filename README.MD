[Introduction to ML using JAX](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2022/blob/main/Introduction_to_ML_using_JAX.ipynb) | In this tutorial, we will learn about JAX, a new machine learning framework that has taken deep learning research by storm! JAX is praised for its speed, and we will learn how to achieve these speedups, using core concepts in JAX, such as automatic differentiation (`grad`), parallelization (`pmap`), vectorization (`vmap`), just-in-time compilation (`jit`), and more. We will then use what we have learned to implement Linear Regression effectively while learning some of the fundamentals of optimization. | [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2022/blob/main/Introduction_to_ML_using_JAX.ipynb) | 
[Bayesian Deep Learning](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2022/blob/main/Bayesian_Deep_Learning_Prac.ipynb) | Bayesian inference provides us with the tools to update our beliefs consistently when we observe data. Compared to the, more common, loss minimisation approach to learning, Bayesian methods offer us calibrated uncertainty estimates, resistance to overfitting, and even approaches to select hyper-parameters without a validation set. üöÄIn this prac we will learn to do all of these things!üöÄ | [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2022/blob/main/Bayesian_Deep_Learning_Prac.ipynb) | 
[Transformers and Attention](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2022/blob/main/Introduction_to_ML_using_JAX.ipynb) | The transformer architecture, introduced in Vaswani et al. 2017's paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762?amp=1), has significantly impacted the deep learning field. It has arguably become the de-facto architecture for complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It can also be applied in various domains reaching state-of-the-art performance, including computer vision and reinforcement learning. Transformers, as the title of the original paper implies, are almost entirely based on a concept known as attention. Attention allows models to "focus" on different parts of an input; while considering the entire context of the input versus an RNN, that operates on the data sequentially. In this practical, we will introduce attention in greater detail and build the entire transformer architecture block by block to see why it is such a robust and powerful architecture | [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2022/blob/main/attention_and_transformers.ipynb) | 
[Deep Generative Models](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2022/blob/main/deep_generative_models.ipynb) | In this practical, we will investigate the fundamentals of generative modelling ‚Äì a machine learning framework that allows us to learn how to sample new unseen data points that match the distribution of our training dataset. Generative modelling, though a powerful and flexible framework‚Äìwhich has provided many exciting advances in ML‚Äìhas its own challenges and limitations. This practical will walk you through such challenges and will illustrate how to solve them by implementing a Denoising Diffusion Model (a.k.a. a Score-Based Generative Model), which is the backbone of the recent and exciting [DALLE¬∑2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) and [Imagen](https://imagen.research.google/) models that we‚Äôve all seen on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dalle2%20%23imagen&src=typed_query). | [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2022/blob/main/deep_generative_models.ipynb) |
