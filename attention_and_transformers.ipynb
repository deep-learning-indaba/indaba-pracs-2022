        "**Introduction:** \n",
        "\n",
        "The transformer architecture, introduced in Vaswani et al. 2017 .'s paper Attention is All You Need, has significantly impacted the deep learning field. It has arguably become the de-facto architecture for complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks; and can outperform benchmarks in various domains, including computer vision and reinforcement learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformers, as the title of the original paper implies, are almost entirely based on a concept known as attention. Attention allows models to \"focus\" on different parts of an input; while considering the entire context of the input versus an RNN, that operates on the data sequentially.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this practical, we will introduce attention in greater detail and build the entire transformer architecture block by block to see why it is such a robust and powerful architecture.\n",

        "**Aims/Learning Objectives:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Learn how different attention mechanisms can be implemented.\n",
        "- Learn and create the basic building blocks from scratch for the most common transformer architectures.\n",
        "- Learn how to train a sequence-sequence model.\n",
        "- Create and train a small GPT inspired model.\n",
        "- Learn how to use the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) library for quicker development cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prerequisites:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Basic understanding of Jax and Haiku\n",
        "- Basic understanding linear algebra\n",
        "- RNN based sequence-sequence models\n",
        "- Token/Word embedding techniques\n",
        "\n",
        "**Outline:** \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Before you start:**\n",
        "\n",
        "For this practical, you will need to use a GPU to speed up training. To do this, go to the \"Runtime\" menu in Colab, select \"Change runtime type\" and then in the popup menu, choose \"GPU\" in the \"Hardware accelerator\" box."
