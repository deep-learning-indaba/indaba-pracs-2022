JAX is praised for its speed, and we will learn how to achieve these speedups, using core concepts in JAX, such as automatic differentiation (`grad`), parallelization (`pmap`), vectorization (`vmap`), just-in-time compilation (`jit`), and more. We will then use what we have learned to implement Linear Regression effectively while learning some of the fundamentals of optimization.\n",

        "\n",
        "[JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a python package for writing composable numerical transformations. It leverages [Autograd](https://github.com/hips/autograd) and [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla) (Accelerated Linear Algebra), to achieve high-performance numerical computing, which is particularly relevant in machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "It provides functionality such as automatic differentiation (`grad`), parallelization (`pmap`), vectorization (`vmap`), just-in-time compilation (`jit`), and more. These transforms operate on [pure functions](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#pure-functions), so JAX encourages a **functional programming** paradigm. Furthermore, the use of XLA  allows one to target different kinds of accelerators (CPU, GPU and TPU), without code changes.  \n",
        "\n",
        "JAX is different from frameworks such as PyTorch or Tensorflow (TF). It is more low-level and minimalistic. JAX simply offers a set of primitives (simple operations) like `jit` and `vmap`, and relies on other libraries for other things e.g. using the data loader from PyTorch or TF. Due to JAX's simplicity, it is commonly used with higher-level neural network libraries such as [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku) or [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax).

        "> \n",
        "> When jit-compiling a function, we want to compile and cache a version of the function that can handle multiple different argument types (so we don't have to recompile for each function evaluation). For example, when we compile a function on an array `jnp.array([1., 2., 3.], jnp.float32)`, we would likely also want to use the compiled function for `jnp.array([4., 5., 6.], jnp.float32)`. \n",
        "> \n",
        "> To achieve this, JAX traces your code based on abstract values. The default abstraction level is a ShapedArray - array that has a fixed size and dtype, for example, if we trace a function using `ShapedArray((3,), jnp.float32)`,  it can be reused for any concrete array of size 3, and float32 dtype. \n",

        "- JAX combines Autograd and XLA to perform **accelerated** 🚀 numerical computations. These computations are achieved using transforms such as `jit`,`grad`,`vmap` and `pmap`.\n",
        "- JAX's `grad` function automatically calculates the gradients of your functions for you! \n",
        "- Gradient descent is an effective algorithm to learn linear models, but also more complicated models, where analytical solutions don't exist. \n",
        "- We need to be careful not to over-fit or under-fit on our datasets. \n",
        "- Haiku and Optax make training JAX models more convenient.  \n",

        "\n",
        "**Next Steps:** \n",
