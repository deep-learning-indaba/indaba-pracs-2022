    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn about JAX, a new machine learning framework that has taken deep learning research by storm! JAX is praised for its speed, and we will learn how to achieve these speedups, using core concepts in JAX, such as automatic differentiation (`grad`), parallelization (`pmap`), vectorization (`vmap`), just-in-time compilation (`jit`), and more. We will then use what we have learned to implement Linear Regression effectively while learning some of the fundamentals of optimization.\n",

    "# **Part 1 - Basics of JAX**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is JAX?**\n",
    "\n",
    "[JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a python package for writing composable numerical transformations. It leverages [Autograd](https://github.com/hips/autograd) and [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla) (Accelerated Linear Algebra), to achieve high-performance numerical computing, which is particularly relevant in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides functionality such as automatic differentiation (`grad`), parallelization (`pmap`), vectorization (`vmap`), just-in-time compilation (`jit`), and more. These transforms operate on [pure functions](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#pure-functions), so JAX encourages a **functional programming** paradigm. Furthermore, the use of XLA  allows one to target different kinds of accelerators (CPU, GPU and TPU), without code changes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "JAX is different from frameworks such as PyTorch or Tensorflow (TF). It is more low-level and minimalistic. JAX simply offers a set of primitives (simple operations) like `jit` and `vmap`, and relies on other libraries for other things e.g. using the data loader from PyTorch or TF. Due to JAX's simplicity, it is commonly used with higher-level neural network libraries such as [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku) or [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax). (Imagine writing complicated architectures using a NumPy-like interface alone! 😮 )   "
